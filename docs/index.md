## Hosting and Git workflow:

### Frontend is hosted on Netlify:

1. Install Netlify CLI in client folder - [Get started with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)

1. `cd client` > `npm run build`

1. `netlify deploy` `./build`

1. `netlify deploy --prod` `./build`

**Important:**

Have domain variable in App.js to toggle between using localhost for fetch routes or heroku domain for fetch routes to make it easier to develop. Use domain - localhost when developing, but switch to domain = heroku when building.

### Backend is hosted on Heroku:

1. Install Heroku CLI in server folder - [Heroku - Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)

1. `cd server`

1. `git add .`

1. `git commit -am "message"`

1. `git push heroku main`

## Routing:

### Front End:

1. Uses [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) `npm i react-router-dom`

1. Surround App in BrowserRouter in index.js

1. Uses Routes and Route from RRD in App.js to decide which JS file (aka page) is shown when browser is in certain route (ex. â€œ/Signup")

### Back End:

1. Uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) `npm i express`

1. To retrieve and/or manipulate data, uses fetch API unless [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is required to use things like [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for image upload
